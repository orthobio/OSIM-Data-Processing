# OSIM-Data-Processing
This program bulk handles experiments with more than one trial. OSIM_DataProcessing processes all Excel files in a folder and gives user statistics on the experiment.

Prepare a folder by dragging all relvant Excel files generated by the OSIM into it. Please make sure that all Excel files are from the same movement (i.e. if you have an experimment where you ran 2-6 and 1-6, create two separate folders '2-6' and '1-6' and drag the corresponding Excel files into each of them. Next, run OSIM_DataProcessing. The program will guide you to make your desired plots.
